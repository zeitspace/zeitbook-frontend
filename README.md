# Zeitbook

The starter application for Zeitspace's workshop on Progressive Web Apps.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed:

1. A recent version of Google Chrome.
1. A text editor or an IDE. If you don’t have one installed, we recommend [Atom](https://atom.io).
1. A command-line shell. If you're on Windows, you can use `cmd` or PowerShell. On a Mac, you can use Terminal.
1. [Git](https://git-scm.com). After installing Git, clone the this repository by running `git clone https://github.com/zeitspace/zeitbook-frontend.git`. If you don't want to install Git, you can [download the starter application as a ZIP file](https://github.com/zeitspace/zeitbook-frontend/archive/master.zip).
1. [Node.js and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Optionally, you can install the following software to improve your development experience:

1. The [LiveReload Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei?hl=en). This extension will automatically refresh the browser after you make a change to a JavaScript source file. Even cooler, it will update changed CSS files without reloading the page.
